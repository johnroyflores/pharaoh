            <p><span class = "highlight">Founded in 2015 by 3 guys and a hound dog named Violet. Our goal from the beginning was to provide a superior CO2 oil to the Colorado market and sell the highest quality Marijuana possible. We saw a lack of uniformity and passion in the Marijuana industry and have wanted to change it ever since. Founded as Loud Labs we have undergone the creation of a modest sized grow to provide premium cannabis for our lab. The 1st key to creating the best oil is starting with the best material. The 2nd key is finding the right people. Our company employees a total of 7 people who are all working towards the same goal, which is to provide a premium product without cutting any corners. The 3rd key for Loud Labs was cultivating lasting relationships. In the year and a half we have been in business we have had zero turnover and operate on the idea of “Treat everyone as if they are your father, mother, sister or brother. “ This take on life has enabled us to create a family at Loud Labs as well as a family with the dispensaries who pass on our product to the great state of Colorado. </span></p>
